This GitHub repository contains the code, files, images, and results obtained during my work on the detection of water stress in Centella asiatica plants.

The 'Visualize data' folder contains images extracted from hyperspectral data for different plants (RGB images, images representing values of certain vegetation indices such as NDVI, mRENDVI, PSRI, SR4, as well as near-infrared light intensity values), along with the Python code used to obtain them.

The 'My approach' folder compiles the results obtained during my approach to detect water stress from spectral images of plants, along with the Python code used to obtain them.
